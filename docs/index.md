# Abstract

Project red light, green light strives to replicate the first game of the popular Netflix series Squid Game. While this is a game usually played with just people, the show displayed how a machine can be involved in creating a very accurate system to decide which players have won or lost. The robot doll in the series uses cameras to detect people as well as their movement, and shoots at the ones that fail to remain still during the red light. Similarly, our project involves a camera that represents a doll. We want to have this camera observe a scene, and correctly process each player during the game, keeping track of their movement and whether they’ve lost or not. We also want to mimic the shooting by having a laser point to the people who are now “out”. Our goal is to have our system perform well enough that it can be used in settings to actually play the game. We will use existing methods for complex aspects like person detection, as well as implement our own ideas to create a sufficient environment for the game.
